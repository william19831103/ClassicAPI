// Aura caster / duration cache, fed by a co-hook on `SMSG_SPELL_GO`
// (`FUN_SPELL_GO`). The vanilla unit aura array (`UNIT_FIELD_AURA`) stores
// only spell IDs — it has no record of *who* cast an aura, and no
// cast/expiration timing for any unit but the local player. The one place
// the client ever sees the caster + a server-authoritative duration is the
// `SMSG_SPELL_GO` packet at cast time. We parse it (the same packet
// nampower parses for its `AURA_CAST_ON_*` events) and remember, per
// `(targetGuid, spellId, casterGuid)`, who cast it and when it should expire.
//
// The caster belongs in that key because it belongs in the server's: two
// same-class raiders' Corruption on one boss are two auras in two descriptor
// slots, and a `(target, spell)` cache holds one entry for both — the second
// cast overwrites the first caster's timing, and either copy falling off
// evicts the survivor's entry too. The descriptor stores only spell IDs, so
// each entry additionally records the slot its aura was seated in
// (`OnAuraAdded`), which is what lets a per-slot query name the right instance.
//
// `Aura::Data::Push` consults this to fill `sourceUnit` (caster, resolved
// to a unit token) and `expirationTime` for non-player units. The cache is
// inherently best-effort: it only knows about casts observed since login,
// and an entry survives until it expires (combat-duration auras) or is
// evicted under pressure. Misses leave the modern-truthful defaults
// (`sourceUnit` nil, `expirationTime` 0) in place — same outcome as before
// this module existed.

// `*outDurationMs` is the applied duration including the caster's modifiers
// (talents etc.; 0 = none) — use it for the `duration` field so it stays
