namespace Unit::Sheath {

// `GetSheathState()` — returns which weapon type the local player currently
// has drawn. Takes no arguments. The return is **1-based**, matching modern
// WoW's contract:
//   1 = None   (weapons sheathed / put away)
//   2 = Melee  (melee weapon drawn)
//   3 = Ranged (ranged weapon drawn)
//
// Vanilla 1.12 ships `ToggleSheath` but no getter. The engine keeps the
// sheath state as a plain CGUnit int member at OFF_UNIT_SHEATH_STATE (+0xD40),
// 0-based (0 = sheathed, 1 = melee, 2 = ranged) — the same field the engine's
// own toggler `FUN_005EB480` reads to pick the next state and its setter
// `FUN_00611CF0` writes. We read the local player's value and add 1 for the
// Lua contract.
//
// Returns 1 (None) when the player CGUnit isn't resolvable yet (out of
// world) — the "weapons put away" default. `FUN_RESOLVE_UNIT_TOKEN` returns
// null for `"player"` out of world rather than raising, so this is safe from
// any context.
